# Doc-Classification-Inception-V2

 Document Classification that directly learns a
 mapping from document images to a compact Euclidean space where distances
 directly correspond to a measure of document similarity. I hope tasks such as
 Document grouping, classifing and clustering can be easily implemented using
 techniques with Siamese Network (Inception v2) embeddings as feature vectors.
